```stub
Create a FormatJS function in React that can format numbers
```

<details open id="d242c301d8b781637f6e2cfb14e0ebd6">
<summary></summary>

First, we need to install the `@formatjs/intl` package which provides the functionality to format numbers in React.

DESCRIPTION: Installing the `@formatjs/intl` package using npm.

```bash
npm install @formatjs/intl
```

Next, we will create a new file `NumberFormatter.js` in the `src` directory and write a function that uses the `Intl.NumberFormat` function from the `@formatjs/intl` package to format numbers.

DESCRIPTION: Creating a new file `src/NumberFormatter.js` and writing a function to format numbers.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {IntlProvider, createIntl, createIntlCache} from '@formatjs/intl';

// This is optional but highly recommended
// since it prevents memory leak
const cache = createIntlCache()

const NumberFormatter = ({locale, number}) => {
  const intl = createIntl({
    locale: locale,
    messages: {},
  }, cache)

  return (
    <span>{intl.formatNumber(number)}</span>
  );
};

export default NumberFormatter;
```

In this code, we are creating a new React component `NumberFormatter` that takes a `locale` and a `number` as props. The `locale` prop is used to determine the formatting style of the number. The `number` prop is the number that we want to format. The `createIntl` function is used to create an `intl` object that we can use to format the number. The formatted number is then rendered inside a `span` element.

```stub
Show European formatting as the example
```

<details open id="525309a4c412267c150254fd88e86997">
<summary></summary>

Sure, let's create a Python script that formats a number into the European format (i.e., using a comma as the decimal separator and a period as the thousands separator). We'll use the `locale` module in Python to achieve this. 

The script will be saved as `euro_format.py` in the current directory.

```python
import locale

# Set to European locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE.utf8')

def format_euro(num):
    return locale.format_string("%d", num, grouping=True)

# Test the function
print(format_euro(1234567.89))
```

This script first sets the locale to 'de_DE.utf8', which is the locale for Germany (a European country). Then it defines a function `format_euro` that takes a number and returns it formatted in the European style. Finally, it tests the function by formatting the number 1234567.89.

Please note that the available locales and their names depend on your system. 'de_DE.utf8' might not be available on all systems. If it's not available on your system, you need to install it or use a different locale that is available and uses the European number formatting style.
