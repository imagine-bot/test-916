```stub
Create a FormatJS function in React that can format numbers
```

<details open id="d242c301d8b781637f6e2cfb14e0ebd6">
<summary></summary>

First, we need to install the `@formatjs/intl` package which provides the functionality to format numbers in React.

DESCRIPTION: Installing the `@formatjs/intl` package using npm.

```bash
npm install @formatjs/intl
```

Next, we will create a new file `NumberFormatter.js` in the `src` directory and write a function that uses the `Intl.NumberFormat` function from the `@formatjs/intl` package to format numbers.

DESCRIPTION: Creating a new file `src/NumberFormatter.js` and writing a function to format numbers.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {IntlProvider, createIntl, createIntlCache} from '@formatjs/intl';

// This is optional but highly recommended
// since it prevents memory leak
const cache = createIntlCache()

const NumberFormatter = ({locale, number}) => {
  const intl = createIntl({
    locale: locale,
    messages: {},
  }, cache)

  return (
    <span>{intl.formatNumber(number)}</span>
  );
};

export default NumberFormatter;
```

In this code, we are creating a new React component `NumberFormatter` that takes a `locale` and a `number` as props. The `locale` prop is used to determine the formatting style of the number. The `number` prop is the number that we want to format. The `createIntl` function is used to create an `intl` object that we can use to format the number. The formatted number is then rendered inside a `span` element.

Add an example of european formatting
```

<details open id="2e7cfdeaccd527916e02ffe6da8a0b2c">
<summary></summary>

To demonstrate European formatting, let's create a Python script that formats a date in the European style (day/month/year) and a number in the European style (comma as decimal separator, period as thousands separator).

First, we'll create a .env file to store our date and number for formatting.

File: /path/to/your/app/.env

```env
DATE_TO_FORMAT=2022-12-31
NUMBER_TO_FORMAT=1234567.89
```

Next, we'll create a Python script that reads these values from the .env file, formats them in the European style, and prints the results.

File: /path/to/your/app/format_european.py

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from datetime import datetime
import locale

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get date and number from environment variables
date_to_format = os.getenv('DATE_TO_FORMAT')
number_to_format = float(os.getenv('NUMBER_TO_FORMAT'))

# Set locale to a European locale (e.g., French) to get European number formatting
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'fr_FR.utf8')

# Format date in European style (day/month/year)
date = datetime.strptime(date_to_format, '%Y-%m-%d')
formatted_date = date.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')

# Format number in European style (comma as decimal separator, period as thousands separator)
formatted_number = locale.format_string('%f', number_to_format, grouping=True)

print(f'Formatted date: {formatted_date}')
print(f'Formatted number: {formatted_number}')
```

This script uses the `datetime` module to format the date and the `locale` module to format the number. The `locale` module's `setlocale` function is used to set the locale to a European locale (in this case, French), which affects the way numbers are formatted by the `format_string` function.
